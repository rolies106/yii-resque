            'class' => 'application.components.yii-resque.RResque',
            'server' => 'localhost',    // Redis server address
            'port' => '6379',           // Redis server port
            'database' => 0,             // Redis database number
            'password' => ''            // Redis password auth, set to '' or null when no auth needed

## How to

### Create job and Workers

You can put this line where ever you want to add jobs to queue

```php
    Yii::app()->resque->createJob('queue_name', 'Worker_ClassWorker', $args = array());
```

Put your workers inside Worker folder and name the class with ```Worker_``` as prefix, e.g you want to create worker with name SendEmail then you can create file inside Worker folder and name it SendEmail.php, class inside this file must be ```Worker_SendEmail```

### Start and Stop workers

Run this command from your console/terminal :

Start queue

```bash
    yiic rresque start
```

Stop queue :

```bash
    yiic rresque stop
```

Stop queue with QUIT signal :

```bash
    yiic rresque stop --quit=true
```
